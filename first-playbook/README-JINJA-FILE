In this tutorial I will explain two examples , 

1- Local factory utilization " ansible -m setup localhost ( ip_address of host ) 
2- Writting Jinja file for define variable in playboo/apache/default/main.yml "

## Story behind this article, 
## I was trying to configure multipule web app server , with different IP listner , 
## For example I have one web server running on 192.168.2.10 and second is running on 192.168.2.11 and listenner address is different. 
Listen 192.168.2.10:80

I want to write a simple httpd.conf with ansible that help my web server to configure with local interface "eth0" listner IP address. 


Step 1 : Create  a New ansible playbook , 
mkdir apache-playbook
ansible-galaxy init apache

Step 2 : Create hosts file , 
cat hosts
[web]
localhost

Step 3 : Create site.yml , 

---
- name: Install apache
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    ip: 192.168.2.12
    http_port: 80
    max_client: 200
  roles:
       - apache


Step 4: 

tree  apache/
apache/
├── defaults
│   └── main.yml
├── handlers
│   └── main.yml
├── meta
│   └── main.yml
├── README.md
├── tasks
│   └── main.yml
├── tests
│   ├── inventory
│   └── test.yml
└── vars
    └── main.yml


Step 5: Write tasks/main.yml  

---
# tasks file for apache
- name: install apache
  yum: pkg=httpd state=present
- name: copy httpd.conf file,
  template: src=/tmp/httpd.conf.jinja dest=/httpd.conf  owner=apache group=apache
  
  
  Step 6: User template file that I mentioned in tasks/main.yml ' I use wrong location so I don't mess up with my actuall http configuration. 
  
  ( This Value  "facter_network_eth0" I obtain from ansible -m setup localhost command. ) This is a pre defined factor that have network interface value. 
  
  
  
 cat /tmp/httpd.conf.jinja  | grep -i listen
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to
Listen {{ facter_network_eth0 }}:80
Listen 80
Listen 8080
You have new mail in /var/spool/mail/root


Step 7 : 

Just for testing I enter the following one variable at the end. 

website: {{ website }}


Step 8 : in this  playbook/apache/default/main.yml   file I will define value of website. 

root@python apache-playbook]# cat apache/defaults/main.yml
---
# defaults file for apache
website: talhajilal

Conclusion, 

# ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml 


What will happen , 

In destination directory , 


cat /httpd.conf | grep -i listen
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to
Listen 23.239.23.0:80

cat /httpd.conf | tail -n 2

website: talhajilal



Perfect.
